# Dining-Philosophers

Implement my solution to the dining philosopher problem.

Constrains:
1. Philosopher can eat only when he has access to both spoons.
2. Philosopher tries to get access to left spoon first, and then right spoon.
3. If, after getting access to left spoon, right spoon is not available, philosopher has to release the left spoon and restart from beginning after a wait of one second.
